### PCIst analysis output

I tried (with a lot of help from Claude AI) to recreate the plots from Comolatti et al., 2019. The actual PCIst values are derived directly from the code that can be found at https://github.com/renzocom/PCIst/blob/master/PCIst/pci_st.py

These are PCIst results from 10 sessions of TMS-EEG recorded from the same subject (dozing and awake). The stimulation site is either the left motor cortex or the DLPFC.
