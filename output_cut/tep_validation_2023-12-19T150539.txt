3. Overall Assessment
------------------------------

Signal Quality Score: 66.7%
Component Quality Score: 50.0%
Channel Utilization: 12.5%

Warnings and Recommendations:
- Signal quality does not meet minimum criteria
  * Poor SNR, consider increasing number of trials or improving noise reduction
- TEP components do not match expected characteristics
  * N15-P30: Poor SNR
  * N45: Poor SNR
  * P60: Poor SNR
  * N100: Poor SNR
  * P180: Poor SNR
- Low channel utilization, check electrode placement and contact quality

Methodology Notes:
- TEP criteria based on established literature
- SNR threshold set at 3:1
- Spatial consistency measured as coefficient of variation across channels
- Component validation includes latency, amplitude, SNR, and spatial distribution
