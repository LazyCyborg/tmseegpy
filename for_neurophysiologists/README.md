## Sample epochs
These are epochs from one session of TMS-EEG of the same subject when awake and also when dozing.

- Sample epochs before preprocessing:
 The epochs are first plotted after bad epoch rejection by amplitude and with the FASTER algorithm. 

- Sample epochs after preprocessing:
These are the same epochs plotted after having applied the preprocessing pipeline outlined in the main README under "Example pipeline".
